# Q1 and Q2  

admissible 
1. not negative  
2. underestimate of the true store.  
3. the target state must be 0 if  admissible heuristic.  
  
 admissible heuristic
h1(i) <= h*(i) for i from 1 to 7  


# Q3 
a pure strategy is (x1,x2)  
case 1: all in 0 to 7, not equ  
case 2: x1 0, 0< x2 <=7
case 3: x1 the same, x2 0  
case 4: x1 and x2 7  
case 5: both 0  
no reason offer larger than 7, since it worth 7  
simple case, case 1 to case 5  
1. case 1: 
   2. if x1 = x2: p2 wants to deviate 
   3. person that offers less wants to deviate 
2. case 2: player 1 want to deviate. and p2 also wants to deviate since pay too much  
3. case 3: x1 will still want to deviate since p1 is paying too much to win.  
4. case 4: p1 win, p2 want to deviate, if the one loose still need to pay, otherwise, not likely to deviate 
5. 

there is no pure strategy of Nash Equal  

there might be some case of Nash Equal in some other variance of the game.  
  
# Q4  
Alpha Beta pruning  
 Max player have 7 action available.  
Min  

# Q5
