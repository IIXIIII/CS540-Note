# Game Theory, Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning  

## **Static Evaluation Function**  
A static evaluation function, also known as a **heuristic evaluation** function, is a function used by computer programs to estimate a game position's value or goodness. 
It's used in game tree search to estimate the quality of a board configuration and the likelihood of a player winning.

### How it works  
the biger the batter, negative for good, vise versa  
### How it's used  
Static evaluation is used in the **minimax search algorithm** with **alpha-beta pruning**, which is the algorithm used for two-player games like chess.  





**minimax search algorithm**   
recursively explore the game, find every branch of the game, then choose the next step base on the result that lead to the best result.
